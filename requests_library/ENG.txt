"We’ve been directed by the president to continue the investigation, get our material together but not actually implement anything pending the outcome of the negotiation," U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on July 26. "What we’ve agreed to is not to impose automotive tariffs while the negotiations are under way."

The threat of tariffs on car imports and levies already imposed on other goods including steel have strained relations between the U.S. and its closest allies. Trade protectionism adds to a series of disputes, ranging from climate change to Middle East policy, which have upended the ties binding together developed nations since Trump’s election in office.
